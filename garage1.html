<!__Tyre Manufacturing__>
<h2>Tyre Manufacturing</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Pneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world. Tire production starts with bulk raw materials such as rubber (60% -70% synthetic[22][23]), carbon black, and chemicals and produces numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured. Many kinds of rubber are used, the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer. The article Tire manufacturing describes the components assembled to make a tire, the various materials used, the manufacturing processes and machinery, and the overall business model.
Styrene-butadiene copolymer (chemical structure pictured) is the most popular material used in the production of rubber tires.[12]
In 2004, $80 billion of tires were sold worldwide,[24] in 2010 it was $140 billion[25] (approximately 34% growth adjusting for inflation), and is expected to grow to $258 billion per year by 2019.[26] In 2015, the US manufactured almost 170 million tires.[27] Over 2.5 billion tires are manufactured annually, making the tire industry a major consumer of natural rubber. It is estimated that by 2019, 3 billion tires will be to be sold globally every year.[26]
As of 2011, the top three tire manufacturing companies by revenue were Bridgestone (manufacturing 190 million tires), Michelin (184 million), Goodyear (181 million); they were followed by Continental, and Pirelli.[28][29] The Lego group produced over 318 million toy tires in 2011 and was recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest annual production of tires by any manufacturer.[30][31]
